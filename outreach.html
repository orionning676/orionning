        										<p>As a grad student, I'm currently an admin and organizer for Splash at Berkeley, a semesterly
        											program which brings around &gt;300 high school students to Berkeley for one glorious day to learn
        											about ~100 different topics taught by undergraduates and graduate students.
        											I'm also a teacher for Splash. Over the years I've taught several courses for Splash broadly related to physics, mathematics, and
        											astrophysics. These include courses about dark matter, relativity, group theory and algebra, complex analysis, and others.</p>

                            <p>You can find a list and description of courses I've taught for Splash <a href="https://berkeley.learningu.org/teach/teachers/orionning/bio.html" class="linku">here</a>.

                            <p>The Astronomy Department at UC Berkeley offers an amazing monthly program called <a href="https://astro.berkeley.edu/news/events/astro-night/" class="linku">Astro Night</a>,
                            which facilitates a public lecture followed by stargazing using Berkeley's telescopes atop Campbell Hall.
                            I gave one of these public lectures on Oct. 3, 2024, about dark matter and my work straddling the
                            interface of astrophysics and particle physics. </p>

                            <p>In Fall 2021, I was a TA for Physics 110B, which is an elective course covering advanced topics in
                              upper-division electromagnetism. This includes further applications of waves and optics, and then
                              coverage of electrodynamics, including Green's functions, radiation, and multipole expansions.</p>

                            <p>When I was an undergraduate, I was especially proud of leading and designing a for-credit student-run course at Berkeley (DeCal)
                              called "Beginner's Guide to the Universe". This course aimed to introduce the modern landscape of
                              physics and astronomy to a general student audience in a way that emphasizes the ability to
                              critically analyze contemporary physics headlines with both excitement and skepticism. The course
                              was registered under the number Astronomy 98, for 2 units.</p>

                            <p>This course's first incarnation was founded in 2019 by the amazing binary Dholakia Brothers
                              (<a href="https://shishirdholakia.github.io/" class="linku">Shishir</a> and <a href="https://shashankdholakia.github.io/" class="linku">Shashank</a>)
                              and the inimitable <a href="https://nicholasrui.com/" class="linku">Nicholas Rui</a>. It was continued and expanded upon
                              by <a href="https://www.physics.ucsb.edu/people/yonna-kim-0" class="linku">Yonna Kim</a> and myself in 2020.
                              I became lead facilitator in the 2021-2022 academic year. Roles included course design, problem sets,
                              grading, leading thoughtful discussions, and, of course, giving lectures about topics ranging from
                              classical and quantum physics, to astrophysics and cosmology, to particle physics and quantum information.
                              Particular emphasis was placed on non-physics students being able to decipher modern developments in physics and astronomy,
                              for example the development of JWST, or the Muon g-2 experiment at Fermilab, or Google's quantum computing-related press releases.</p>

                            <p>You can find an example syllabus during my tenure as lead faciliator here (link).
                              The typical number of enrolled students was about ~60.</p>
