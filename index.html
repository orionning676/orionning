    <p>Welcome to my little corner of the Internet! This website is currently a work in progress.</p>
    <p>I'm currently a senior undergraduate physics and mathematics double major at the University of California, Berkeley. I am broadly interested in high-energy theory, especially with applications toward particle phenomenology. </p>
    <p>In my undergraduate years I have been fortunate to work deeply on a variety of orthogonal projects. I am currently writing my senior thesis with Prof. <a href="https://physics.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/ori-ganor">Ori Ganor</a> working on 6D (2,0) superconformal quantum field theories and the renormalizability of 'curvepole' field theories. I have also worked with Prof. <a href="https://physics.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/yury-kolomensky">Yury Kolomensky</a> in experimental particle physics as part of the Mu2e experiment, in addition to a side project analyzing the claimed X17 particle. Finally, I worked with Prof. <a href="https://personal.utdallas.edu/~mishak/">Mustapha Ishak</a> (at UT Dallas) constraining cosmological parameters in Modified Gravity theories toward the dark energy problem. You can read more about my research and what I find exciting in the pages below.</p>
