                <p>We know that dark matter (DM) is a real phenomena observable through a variety
                  of astrophysical and cosmological probes, but what is it really? My research
                  revolves trying to answer this question at the particle level. Could dark matter
                  be some yet unseen fundamental particle beyond the Standard Model (SM) of physics?
                  What would be its properties?</p>
                <p>I work in a field broadly known as 'indirect detection', which searches for
                  signatures of hypothetical dark matter particle candidates through astrophysics.
                  What this means is that given some dark matter particle model in mind (popular
                  candidates these days include the axion, higgsinos, or sterile neutrinos), we can try to
                  predict evidence of this model through astrophysical phenomena (stars, galaxies, cosmology, etc.),
                  combined with a variety of often novel and/or intensive statistical and data analysis technqiues.
                  The ideas and methods are as diverse as the entire field of astrophysics, and given
                  that there are roughly ~80 orders of magnitude of unconstrained dark matter particle mass,
                  there's much to explore!</p>

                  and past interests that may or may not be related to the dark matter question.</p>

        										It has been known that Magnetic White Dwarfs (MWDs), or white dwarfs with
                            magnetospheres on the order of ~hundreds of MG, could be excellent
                            laboratories for axion physics. Low mass axion-like particles (ALPs) can be
                            produced within the MWD core through the axion-electron coupling, and then
                            convert to X-ray photons in the strong magnetospheres of MWDs, through the
                            axion-photon coupling. My collaborators and I recently identified two new
                            MWDs (PG 0945+246 and WD 1859+148) which have the potential to further
                            constrain the axion-electron axion-photon coupling combination. Using
                            dedicated <i>Chandra</i> observations of these MWDs, we set stringent joint constraints
                            (combined with previous observations of MWD RE J0317-853) on the low-mass
                            axion parameter space when. Further, we demonstrate the slow degradation of the
                            <i>Chandra</i> telescope over the years, which will likely limit prospects of similar
                            searches for axions from MWDs in the future. Interestingly, we also find low-energy
                            non-axion emission from WD 1859+148, which likely comes from magnetosphere effects.

        										Ultralight axions are strongly-motivated particle candidates, often extensively
                            searched for in astrophysical data where their feeble interactions with the SM can be
                            magnified. In our work here, we consider the possibility that axions can be produced
                            thermally in stellar interiors (through the axion-photon coupling), and then can
                            convert to X-ray photons in galactic magnetic fields. Novel in our work, we sum over
                            full stellar populations in select galaxies when calculating the expected axion-induced
                            flux, and extract robust magnetic field profiles from the IllustrisTNG simulations.
                            Analyzing NuSTAR data toward the starburst galaxy M82 and the Virgo-cluster central galaxy M87,
                            we find no evidence for axions and instead set exciting leading constraints on the axion-photon couling
                            for axion masses below roughly ~10<sup>-10</sup> eV.</p>

        										Dark matter, in principle, is all around us. Searching across the sky,
                            one can hypothesize that dark matter can generically decay into photons which
                            may be detectable as a distinct line-like signal. In this work we narrow our
                            scope to X-ray line searches, and re-examine the ability of the past Hitomi
                            telescope in searching for DM decay, while making projections for its
                            successor, XRISM. The Hitomi mission was unfortunately destroyed in orbit in 2016,
                            but we show that the small amount of data it did collect can be optimized for
                            DM decay searches using a new technique, in which we target 'blank sky observations',
                            which are regions of the sky with minimal light and background (as opposed to
                            high density regions which may also have high backgrounds, which were more frequently
                            analyzed). We show, using Hitomi as proof-of-principle, that this blank sky technique
                            gives substantial improvements in constraining the DM decay lifetime, and extend
                            this formalism to the (then upcoming) XRISM mission, which was recently launched in September
                            2024. We projected that XRISM, with its impressive high-resolution spectrometers, will have
                            leading sensitivity to DM decay for masses between roughly 1 to 18 keV. This would have
                            important implications for certain models of DM such as sterile neutrinos and heavy axions.</p>

        										<p>Standard QED in five dimensions, with interacting photons and fermions, is not perturbatively
                            renormalizable. However, the study of QFTs in dimensions higher than four have been increasingly
                            motivated due to string theory, which has suggested the existence of interacting QFTs in five and
                            six dimensions. These particular QFTs can behave like interacting gauge theories in the low-energy
                            limit, and have remained interesting objects of study for decades. In this (ongoing) work,
                            which I became involved with in my undergraduate Senior Honors Thesis, we develop a novel QFT which
                            behaves similar to 5D QED, but, in contrast, is renormalizable. This is due to fermion fields whose
                            quanta are "curvepoles," which are higher-dimensional analogs of magnetic dipoles. These curvepoles
                            also have roles in describing D-branes in strong fluxes, and theories which construct new models of
                            UV completion for lower-dimensional QFTs. Full story, in a preprint form, out (hopefully) soon!</p>
