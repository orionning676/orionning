                <p>We know that dark matter (DM) is a real phenomenon observable through a variety
                  of astrophysical and cosmological probes, but what is it really? My research
                  revolves trying to answer this question at the particle level. Could dark matter
                  be some yet unseen fundamental particle beyond the Standard Model (SM) of physics?
                  What would be its properties?</p>
                <p>I work in a field broadly known as 'indirect detection', which searches for
                  signatures of hypothetical dark matter particle candidates through astrophysics.
                  What this means is that given some dark matter particle model in mind (popular
                  candidates these days include the axion, higgsinos, or sterile neutrinos), we can try to
                  predict evidence of this model through astrophysical phenomena (stars, galaxies, cosmology, etc.),
                  combined with a variety of often novel and/or intensive statistical and data analysis technqiues.
                  The ideas and methods are as diverse as the entire field of astrophysics, and given
                  that the possible dark matter candidate mass can span roughly ~50 orders of magnitude,
                  there's much to explore!</p>

                  and past interests that may or may not be related to the dark matter question.</p>

        					Some of the strongest constraints on axions and axion-like particles come from the extreme conditions within neutron stars (NSs), extremely compact objects held up by neutron degneracy pressure and other nuclear effects. In this work, we study the possibility of a diffuse axion signal coming from the <i>cosmological</i> NS population, which are all NSs produced throughout cosmic history. If axions were to exist, they would be produced from these extreme objects and make up an axion-induced X-ray background permeating our universe today. We search for the signals coming from ultralight axions converting in external NS magnetospheres, as well as the decay of heavier axions into photons produced at a later cosmic epoch, deriving stringent constraints on axion coupling parameters in both scenarios (particularly for our leading heavy axion search where the mass m<sub>a</sub> is within a few orders of magnitude of a keV) with cosmic X-ray background data from NuSTAR, HEAO, Swift, and INTEGRAL. We utilize NS cooling simulations and magnetic field evolution models, study the effects of superfluidity in NSs, make projections for future telescopes, and conclude that the cosmic NSs analyzed here are an exciting avenue to probe deeper and deeper into axion parameter space across an impressively wide range of axion masses.</p>

        										It has been known that Magnetic White Dwarfs (MWDs), or white dwarfs with
                            magnetospheres on the order of ~hundreds of MG, could be excellent
                            laboratories for axion physics. Low mass axion-like particles (ALPs) can be
                            produced within the MWD core through the axion-electron coupling, and then
                            convert to X-ray photons in the strong magnetospheres of MWDs, through the
                            axion-photon coupling. My collaborators and I recently identified two new
                            MWDs (PG 0945+246 and WD 1859+148) which have the potential to further
                            constrain the axion-electron axion-photon coupling combination. Using
                            dedicated <i>Chandra</i> observations of these MWDs, we set stringent joint constraints
                            (combined with previous observations of MWD RE J0317-853) on the low-mass
                            axion parameter space when. Further, we demonstrate the slow degradation of the
                            <i>Chandra</i> telescope over the years, which will likely limit prospects of similar
                            searches for axions from MWDs in the future. Interestingly, we also find low-energy
                            non-axion emission from WD 1859+148, which likely comes from magnetosphere effects.

        										Ultralight axions are strongly-motivated particle candidates, often extensively
                            searched for in astrophysical data where their feeble interactions with the SM can be
                            magnified. In our main work here, we consider the possibility that axions can be produced
                            thermally in stellar interiors (through the axion-photon coupling), and then can
                            convert to X-ray photons in galactic magnetic fields. Novel in our work, we sum over
                            full stellar populations in select galaxies when calculating the expected axion-induced
                            flux, and extract robust magnetic field profiles from the IllustrisTNG simulations.
                            Analyzing NuSTAR data toward the starburst galaxy M82 and the Virgo-cluster central galaxy M87,
                            we find no evidence for axions and instead set exciting leading constraints on the axion-photon couling
                            for axion masses below roughly ~10<sup>-10</sup> eV.</p>

                            <p>This theme of leveraging galactic stellar populations for axion searches is useful in other contexts as well. In several
                            follow-up works, we next considered how to probe the axion-electron coupling through other production processes
                            like electron bremsstrahlung and Compton scattering for axion production in stars. We also searched for
                            particular nuclear de-excitation lines from M1 transitions of various isotopes, giving a distinct X-ray line signature
                            induced by the axion-nucleon coupling. In both of these scenarios, we derive stringent constraints on various axion coupling
                            parameters and also explore other galactic stellar populations like M31 and our own Milky Way bulge. Indeed, we find that stellar populations are incredibly powerful when conducting axion searches in a multitude of scenarios.</p>

        										Dark matter, in principle, is all around us. Searching across the sky,
                            one can hypothesize that dark matter can generically decay into photons which
                            may be detectable as a distinct line-like signal. In this work we narrow our
                            scope to X-ray line searches, and re-examine the ability of the past Hitomi
                            telescope in searching for DM decay, while making projections for its
                            successor, XRISM. The Hitomi mission was unfortunately destroyed in orbit in 2016,
                            but we show that the small amount of data it did collect can be optimized for
                            DM decay searches using a new technique, in which we target 'blank sky observations',
                            which are regions of the sky with minimal light and background (as opposed to
                            high density regions which may also have high backgrounds, which were more frequently
                            analyzed). We show, using Hitomi as proof-of-principle, that this blank sky technique
                            gives substantial improvements in constraining the DM decay lifetime, and extend
                            this formalism to the (then upcoming) XRISM mission, which was recently launched in September
                            2024. We projected that XRISM, with its impressive high-resolution spectrometers, will have
                            leading sensitivity to DM decay for masses between roughly 1 to 18 keV. This would have
                            important implications for certain models of DM such as sterile neutrinos and heavy axions.</p>

        										<p>Standard QED in five dimensions, with interacting photons and fermions, is not perturbatively
                            renormalizable. However, the study of QFTs in dimensions higher than four have been increasingly
                            motivated due to string theory, which has suggested the existence of interacting QFTs in five and
                            six dimensions. These particular QFTs can behave like interacting gauge theories in the low-energy
                            limit, and have remained interesting objects of study for decades. In this (ongoing) work,
                            which I became involved with in my undergraduate Senior Honors Thesis, we develop a novel QFT which
                            behaves similar to 5D QED, but, in contrast, is renormalizable. This is due to fermion fields whose
                            quanta are "curvepoles," which are higher-dimensional analogs of magnetic dipoles. These curvepoles
                            also have roles in describing D-branes in strong fluxes, and theories which construct new models of
                            UV completion for lower-dimensional QFTs. Full story, in a preprint form, out (hopefully) soon!</p>
